### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey – Day 1: Linux Fundamentals

Starting my path toward mastering cybersecurity. Today marks **Day 1**, where I dove into **Linux Fundamentals** — the foundation every security professional needs.

Covered topics:

* Understanding the Linux file system and key directories
* Basic command-line navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, etc.)
* File permissions, ownership, and user management
* Viewing and editing files using `cat`, `less`, `grep`, and text editors
* System monitoring with `top`, `ps`, and `df`
* Basic shell scripting introduction

Takeaway: Getting comfortable with the terminal feels like unlocking the control room of an entire operating system. It’s not just about running commands — it’s about **understanding the system from the inside out**.

This repository will track my daily progress, notes, and labs as I build from fundamentals to advanced topics in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and ethical hacking.
